              offer an unmatched return on investment Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this
              determination one way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a

            </p>
            <p class="font-text style-text-row-three">
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community resources. At a minimum, this means porting
              over your fax number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll
              also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is
              seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information technology vendors are
              important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which we have executed successfully
              with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Thn our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient
              demographics and information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing
              clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a
              wide variety of EMRs.

              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge schedules, and much more.
              Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical,
              practice management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit practice to
              work side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
